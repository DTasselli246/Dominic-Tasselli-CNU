# Final Reflection
### Before The Course Began

Before taking this course, I had absolutely no clue about what Digital Humanities (DH) was. However, my lack of knowledge surrounding DH is what initiated my interest in this subject matter. I assumed that Digital Humanities was some sort of topic that focused on how to effectively communicate with a specific audience that is not included within the typical scholarly realm taught in collegiate English classes. I was partially correct in my assumption that DH is an area of study which promotes non-traditional ways of communicating information, but the rest of my original definition was substantially lacking. After reading a plethora of articles which attempted to define the term Digital Humanities, and spending many class sessions going over different aspects of what Digital Humanities is, I eventually began to form my own definition of this umbrella term.

### Defining Digital Humanities 

I define Digital Humanities as an academic sector which uses modern technology to communicate traditional forms of humanities, such as art, literature, and history, among various audiences. My definition generally summarises the different definitions I have previously read throughout class readings, and different aspects of DH which we have discussed in class, however, I still feel as though this definition does not cover all aspects of Digital Humanities. This definition is surely missing aspects of what DH is, but it is what I believe DH to be primarily focused on.  One of the articles we read and discussed in class explained that Digital Humanities is such a broad and changing term that it can never be defined with complete accuracy, and I completely agree with this. 

After these 16 weeks of classes and completing multiple assignments in relation to DH, I now have a relative understanding of DH, but I know that I still have much more to learn about the field and how it is constantly evolving at a rapid pace.

The readings we completed throughout this year were especially helpful in understanding what DH is. I typically skim through all of the readings I am assigned, but the majority of the readings for this course I felt to be too important to skim through as I normally would. Their importance stems from how abstract Digital Humanities is; each reading provided a new perspective on defining DH, providing examples of DH projects, as well as how the field of DH is constantly evolving.

### Favorite Reading

Although many of the articles we read throughout the semester pertained to DH, Anne Lamott’s article, “Shitty First Drafts'' did not. This article focused on how many writers typically overlook the necessity of having poorly written first drafts within the writing process. This reading was assigned at a pivotal point in the semester where I had lost confidence in my own writing ability, however after reading this article I gained assurance that it is necessary to write down one’s thoughts, no matter how messy the writing may be.

### Useful and Enjoyable Projects

Shortly after we were assigned the “Shitty First Drafts” reading, the CNU map was assigned. This was my favorite assignment of the year because it allowed me to reflect on all of the memories I made during my time at CNU. Additionally, I believe that this assignment, as well as our DH Review Blogs, were the most helpful in getting to know more about DH. The CNU map allowed us to create our own interactive DH map using software we were completely unfamiliar with, giving us a chance to experience what creating a DH project outside of a blog is like. Additionally, the Review Blogs required in-depth analysis of two DH projects, allowing us to discover what aspects of the projects were effective, and what aspects were unneeded. This understanding of common effective and ineffective aspects of DH projects is specifically useful when creating our own DH projects. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to become more familiar with the DH field in general, through examining what types of projects currently exist.

### Growth as a Writer
	
Throughout this class, I believe I have grown substantially as a writer. Academic writing generally scares me, and has since freshman year. Going into this class I was overwhelmed and stressed about what the class would be like and the assignments I would have to complete. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the subject matter of the class and how it correlated to my major of social work, which made the class much more enjoyable and manageable. In learning more about DH, I learned how to write in a more academically informal way, which I have not had to do in the past. Through our weekly tweets, blog posts, and other projects, I have become much more comfortable in writing in a non-research based manner, as well as giving my own personal opinion in my writing. This in turn has allowed me to grow as a student in general. I have become much more confident in my abilities to write in different styles of writing, in addition to learning how to not give up or immediately panic when I am assigned a project which I have no idea how to complete. 

Lastly, I have most substantially grown as a digital humanist. Four months ago I could not explain what Digital Humanities was, and now I am able to plan and complete DH projects in a confident and effective manner. Although I took this class as a mandatory writing intensive elective, I have grown to greatly appreciate the Digital Humanities area of study. I now have a much better understanding of how the field of humanities is evolving, as well as how much of an impact DH has on academia.
