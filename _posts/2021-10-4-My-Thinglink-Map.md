### Introduction
Creating my CNU interactive map provided me with a better understanding of how to use website platforms such as Thinglink. I am not a very technology savvy person. However, this project allowed me to utilize what skills I do have related to computing, while introducing new skills, such as editing photos and videos, that I am able to use in the future. Additionally, my project allowed me to reflect on some of my favorite experiences and places from my freshman year at CNU, my favorite year of college so far. I am going to graduate this May, so I thought focusing on this story would be an enjoyable and reflective experience.

As a senior, it is bittersweet looking through old photos and reminiscing on my past experiences, especially from my first year at CNU. Freshman year was an important transition period for me, where I was tasked with making new friends, becoming acclimated to CNU’s campus, and living on my own. The memories and places I chose as media sources for my map highlight the most important aspects that helped me through this transitional period.

### Inspiration for Media Sources 
My inspiration for the media I used throughout my map stemmed from going through old photos, discussing memories with my friends, and walking through campus. Many of the places and items I included within my project are still relevant to my life today, such as my study spot in the library and going to Lion’s Bridge. It was interesting to think about how much my life has changed at CNU. Freshman year, I never would have imagined living off campus instead of Santoro Hall, or not going to a home Saturday football game or tailgate. This project allowed me to enjoy all the memories I made freshman year over again. 

### Gathering Media
Gathering media was the most entertaining aspect of this project. Originally, I wanted to wake up at sunrise one morning to take pictures and videos of the parts of campus I was going to include. However, because of my schedule I was not able to accomplish this. Instead, I was able to take photos, videos, and sound recordings of campus one afternoon during the week. After overcoming the initial awkwardness of taking photos in front of my peers, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience of gathering media. I walked around CNU and embraced the sounds and beauty of the campus, without having to focus solely on getting to my next class on time. 

Within my map specifically, there is not a color scheme within the icons, rather, I chose colors that I thought would capture the viewer's attention. Additionally, I used the heart icon to represent my favorite selfcare places, the house icon to represent where I lived, the book icon to show education-focused places, and the pin icon to represent other places I visited regularly. 

### Thinglink Experience
Using Thinglink was a great learning process. I was initially overwhelmed, never having used a website platform such as Thinglink that allows the user to create something interactive. However, after going through the website and all of its features, I was pleasantly surprised by the platform’s simplicity. The tools for uploading media were very self-explanatory, requiring very little instruction on how to upload videos, sounds, and photos. Additionally, Thinglink provides a variety of icon options, which allows for the placement of eye-popping interactive buttons throughout the map.

### Conclusion
While creating my map, I realized how much my freshman year influenced the rest of my college experience and helped me become the individual I am today. Each memory I described on the map has allowed me to grow in some way as a person. Football games, the Great Lawn, Subway Station, tailgates, and Santoro Hall allowed me to become more social and make friends that I am going to have for the rest of my life. Places like the CNU fountain and Lion’s Bridge helped me understand how necessary self-care is, especially during stressful times. Additionally, all of my experiences in academic buildings helped me become confident in my own scholarly abilities, which I did not have at the start of my CNU career. Making my map allowed me to realize that these places and experiences forever changed me as a person.
