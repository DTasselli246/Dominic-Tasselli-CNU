## Overview

_Placing Segregation_ explores the spatial segregation of individuals in the 1860s–1870s using an interactive mapping system. The project focuses on three major cities at the time: Washington D.C., Nashville, and Omaha. The characteristics of race, income, and ethnicity are all primary focal points of the project, and are displayed within the mapping section. Dots are used to pinpoint where families lived in the mapping section. By clicking on these dots, the viewer can gain more information about the head of the household, such as gender, race, occupation, estate value, family real estate value, and slave owner status.

## Design and Credit

This project’s design and coding was created with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML functions. The mapping section of the project was completed with the use of more advanced coding, specifically through Leaflet.js, a JavaScript library. The coding used in this project is simple enough and widely accessible for most individuals to utilize for their own project or for overall data gathering.

This project gathers data from the census records and city directories of the 1860s–1870 to match individuals and families to their addresses. All data has been inputted into a CSV file, which is accessible for download on the downloads tab of the project.

The project director has an extensive background in geography, which is the primary focus of this project. Additionally, the transcription assistants are all undergraduate students from different Iowa colleges.

## Findings

The first three pages of the project are maps of Washington D.C., Nashville, and Omaha. These maps are very visually appealing, captivating the viewer's attention immediately. However, these maps are the first three sections of the project, which may be confusing and slightly overwhelming to some users.

When an individual accesses the project, the first thing they encounter are three maps with no instructions on how to use them. The maps appear to not have a  purpose or relevance to the project at all. The project viewer must go to the **About** and **Methods** sections to gain insight on how to use the map and what their overall purpose is. After reading these sections, the user is then able to easily navigate the maps, creating a general purpose for the project. 

The **About** and **Methods** sections provide clear instructions on how to use the maps and navigate the project. Additionally, they provide reasoning for what information is displayed throughout the project and where to access the project’s raw data. These sections are broken down into paragraphs, but lack headings, which may be useful for the user to locate specific information and to separate thoughts. Although highly informative, the reader may feel overwhelmed and lost by this lack of organization.

On the side of the maps, there are checkboxes which allow the user to select certain filters, such as race, ethnicity, and class. This enables the user to see spatial-residential grouping trends within each filter. The **Modern Grayscale** and **Open Geo** filters do not noticeably add anything to the map, which may be a potential coding flaw that prevents certain computers from accessing them. Nonetheless, the maps provide a visually captivating and interactive platform users can use to identify segregation patterns among specific groups, which is the purpose of this project.

The **Interpretations** section does a fantastic job linking the data provided in the map to common segregation trends of the pre and post Civil War era. However, these explanations are not separated and are rather jumbled, making it difficult for the reader to tell the difference between what trends can be seen within the different cities. Although, if read carefully, this section provides a thought-provoking and gripping analysis of apparent segregation patterns within the three major cities.

The **Downloads** section supplies links to datasets which are easily accessible to the project user. These data sets provide raw data which is displayed within the *Maps* section and other information that may be useful to project viewers. 

The **Exercise** section is devoid of all information and sits empty.  This section could be taken out completely until it provides insight surrounding the project. 

### Conclusion

_Placing Segregation_ is a viable resource for both historians and anthropologists. Overall, the project provides clear and engaging visual and written descriptions of segregation trends among Washington D.C., Nashville, and Omaha in the 1860s–1870s.
