### Overview andCredit
The *American Prison Writing Archive at Hamilton College* (APWA) provides access to documents and letters written by current and former incarcerated people among prisons throughout 48 states. This project is a continuation of the book *The Fourth City*, which provides essay transcriptions of incarcerated individuals. The letters in the APWA describe the institutional experiences of prisoners, ranging from employment while in prison, to the psychological effects incarceration had on the inmates. Letters are solicited through prisoner support newsletters provided to inmates throughout the United States. A permission questionnaire is then sent back with the attached letter to the APWA, and if it is appropriate, the letter is transcribed into the letter archives. The primary purpose of this project is to gain valuable insight into the lives of the incarcerated through first hand experiences of the inmates themselves, rather than speculating on generalized information provided by external sources.

## Homepage Findings
The homepage of the APWA is fairly scattered and could be overwhelming to users. Upon first entering the project, there is *History, Process, Mission*, providing a brief overview of the purpose of the project, which is extremely illulumating, catching the viewerâ€™s attention immediately. Beyond this, there are four sections on the left side of the page, each containing a plethora of tabs to search through to find information regarding specific letters, attributes of letter authors, and other information about the project. The format of the homepage is fairly inordinate, which may result in confusion among viewers. Without watching the tutorial on how to use the website, users are likely to be guessing on what is embedded within each section of the project, as well as how to search for specific information. 


### Essays Archive and Search 
Within the Essays Archive section, there are multiple tabs allowing users to narrow down their search for specific essay attributes. Upon entering the Author Names, Author Attributes, Prisons, Languages, and States tabs, there are multiple subsections within each. This allows users to look for specific attributes of the authors. However, the subsections are hidden within the initial tabs, which may result in users overlooking information they were searching for upon entering the project. For example, if an individual selects the *Browse All* tab, a sidebar appears on the right hand side of the page, providing additional author attributes not displayed on the home page, or in the attributes section. The location of these attributes within their embedded state of *some* of the subsections can be easily missed by users, making project navigation difficult.

The *Search* section contains a search bar where the user can look up words that are found within each of the letters, which is a great resource for the project users looking for very specific information. Additionally, the *Search* section provides a dropdown sub section, which allows users to search for terms among specific aspects of the essay, such as the author, title, and  essay I.D. This section is an extremely useful aspect of the project, in addition to being straightforward.


 Although initial project navigation may be a challenge to most users, the *Help* section provides further information on how to search for specific attributes, as well as what attribute is within each section of the Essays archive.


### Help
Above the Project Transcription, there is a *Help* section. Upon entering this section, the user is provided with a [tutorial tab](https://apw.dhinitiative.org/sites/all/custom/videos/apwa-tutorial.mp4) on how to use the website. The tutorial is simple and straightforward while providing necessary information pertaining to how to navigate the project. But once again, the placement of the *Help* section is further down the page rather than at the top, which may result in users overlooking the tutorial tab all together. Consequently, users who overlook this section will likely have difficulty finding the information they are looking for.


### Transcription Project
Within the Transcription Project section, there are different tabs further describing the purpose of the essay, what essays are in the process of being transcribed, rights to privacy, and transcription statistics. Although this section provides valuable information such as what year each essay was added to the project, it is likely to be overlooked by the user due to its location at the bottom left side of the homepage. Additionally, this section offers the opportunity for website users to transcribe essays, which in turn would help strengthen the project's findings. However, this still doesn't alleviate the issue of the section location. The only other mention of the opportunity to transcribe essays is through a small and simple link at the top of the page.

#### Letter Transcriptions
There are multiple differences between the scanned letters of the incarcerated inmates and the typed transcriptions presented in the project. Among some of the scanned letters, there are words that are crossed out or completely capitalized by the author. However, the crossed out and completely capitalized words are not included or mentioned within the transcription. This can take away from the overall message, story, and potential deeper meanings the author is trying to convey. This could be a result of unregulated transcriptions, or flaws in the guidelines and standards of letter transcriptions set forth by the project director.

### Conclusion
The *American Prison Writing Archive at Hamilton College* DH project offers valuable insight into the experiences of incarcerated individuals through the primary source letters of inmates. Overall, this project is a viable and necessary resource for historians, sociologists, or individuals interested in the accounts of incarcerated individuals.
